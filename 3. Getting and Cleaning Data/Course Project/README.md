README
======

This class project's purpose was to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. There were several files provided which needed to be processed to result in two tidy datasets.

This repository contains the following files:
=============================================
        'README.txt'
        
        'run_analysis.R': This commented R-script contains code necessary to process all starter files and produce the two tidy datasets.

        'CodeBook.md': A guide that describes the identifier variables, the feature variables collected, and the manipulations performed (obtaining the mean).
